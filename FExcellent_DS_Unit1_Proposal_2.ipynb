A majority of senior leadership has adopted a resolution to include the term “auto zone” in the domain name of its website. However, a small group of internal marketing expert has been pushing for the inclusion of the term “auto part” somewhere in the domain name of the company’s website. As a result, leadership has brought in a consulting firm to help clarify the impact of not including the term “auto part” in the organization’s domain name.\n",

As a result of customers’ queries, the search engine returns several pages of rankings of auto parts vendors (ranked from 1 to n).  Empirical research (see reference 3) has revealed that about 94 percent of customers click (when they choose to do so, instead of just viewing results) on the top two domain names returned by the search engine (rank 1 and 2). Note: Only organic search results are considered in the model (the model ignores &quot;ads&quot; returned on top of the ranked results’ web page).\n",
