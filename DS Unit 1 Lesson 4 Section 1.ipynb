Answer: Control: Existing Supplement A and Variable: New Supplement B Randomly give existing version of supplement to one group of patients of a particular health care provider. Randomly give the new version of supplement to another group of patients of another health care provider. Collect a random sample, until patient count is large enough, based on confidence level and statistical power estimates. Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in sleeping effects between supplements. Null Hypothesis: There is a significant  difference in sleeping effects between supplements. Perhaps two-tailed t-test reveals that there is no difference between supplements (accept null hypothesis). Perhaps, working up late in the morning could be monitored?\n",
